<span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Considering Report on</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> Additional Protocols of Geneva Conventions, </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Delegates Urge</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> Adherence to International Humanitarian Law During Conflicts</span>
</h4>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">As the Sixth Committee (Legal) today took up the annual report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), speakers highlighted progress made in the development of trade law, including a draft convention on the judicial sale of ships, a model law on identity management and work on the reform of investor-State dispute settlement. </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Ivan Šimonović (Croatia), Chair of UNCITRAL, presenting the Commission’s report on its fifty-fifth session (document </span><span><a href="https://undocs.org/A/77/17"><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">A/77/17</span></span></a></span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">), reported that the Commission finalized three legislative texts, including a draft convention that harmonized the regime regarding the judicial sales of ships. <span> </span>This significant draft would offer adequate legal certainty and protection for purchasers and complemented other international instruments of the maritime law reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">He also drew attention to the Model Law on the Use and Cross-border Recognition of Identity Management and Trust Services.<span>  </span>This Model Law provided an opportunity to validate the principles and approaches of UNCITRAL, such as non-discrimination, technology neutrality and functional equivalence, while highlighting the importance of digital identity and authentication of the actors of digital trade and trust services in the digital age.</span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Giving a detailed overview of all six Working Groups, including Working Group III’s work on the reform of investor-State dispute settlement, he also </span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">underlined the progress made towards a rejuvenation of the Case Law on UNCITRAL </span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">T</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">exts, also known as CLOUT system</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">,</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> </span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">and noted the increased participation from Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, including the UNCITRAL Asia-Pacific, Latin American and Caribbean, and African Days.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Anna Joubin-Bret, Secretary of UNCITRAL and Director of the International Trade </span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">L</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">aw Division, spotlighting the draft convention on the judicial sales of ships and the Model Law on identity management, also recalled that in 2021, the Secretariat requested additional resources for Working Group III, which resulted in respective recruitments and additional sessions held in New York and Vienna.<span>  </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The delegate of Uganda urged countries </span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">that have used the Model Law on identity management to advise the Commission on how States that have not used it can develop its application and harmonize it with their legislation.<span>  </span>However, he noted that the Draft Code of Conduct in its present condition is not complete without regulating the conduct of the counsel.<span>  </span>“As arbitration becomes more international, we must increasingly confront the difficulties that arise from diverging ethical standards in multiple jurisdictions,” he added. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">In this regard, the representative of Chile highlighted the work of UNCITRAL with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes on the preparation of the code of conduct for arbitrators. <span> </span>She expressed hope that the document would be adopted at the Commission’s next session in 2023.<span>  </span>Touching upon online commerce and its regulatory mechanisms, she underlined the practical importance of elaborating the topic on resolution and adjudication for conflicts related to technology.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Similarly, Japan’s delegate spotlighted his country’s project taking stock of developments in dispute resolution in the digital economy. <span> </span>Turning to progress made regarding the enlargement of UNCITRAL’s membership from 60 States to 70, he noted that </span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Japan</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> launched a Vienna-based process as a forum for consultations on this matter, having organized 11 rounds of open-ended informal consultations and a number of bilateral meetings.</span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Algeria’s representative underscored that </span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">the Model Law on the Use and Cross-border Recognition of Identity Management and Trust Services can serve as guidance to Member States as they draft relevant legislation.<span>  </span>It will also enhance trust in Internet transactions.<span>  </span>He also welcomed work on alternative dispute resolution, which is expected to reduce the number of cases wherein disputes end trade relations.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Similarly, the delegate of Austria recognized the importance of finalization and adoption of the Model Law on the Use and Cross-border Recognition of Identity Management and Trust Services.<span>  </span>Further, he noted with interest the progress reports of the different Working Groups, particularly that of Working Group III on the reform of investor-State dispute settlement.</span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">However, the representative of Iran expressed concerns </span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">regarding the implicit implications of the Model Law for the sovereignty of States</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">,</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> </span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">particularly developing and least developed countries, whose nationals or businesses are the main users of cross-border digital services. <span> </span>Further, in regards to Working Group III, he said that the possible reform of investor-State dispute settlement should be comprehensive enough to provide equal opportunity for different points of view and contribute to a fair and equitable dispute settlement system.</span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The Sixth Committee also took up the Secretary-General’s report on the Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions relating to the protection of victims of armed conflicts (document <a href="https://undocs.org/A/77/264">A/77/264</a>), as speakers debated adherence to international humanitarian law, ratification of the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Convention and protection measures for victims of armed conflicts.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The delegate of Switzerland </span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">stressed the importance of universal ratification of the Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocols, noting that his country is the depository of these instruments. <span> </span>While the Geneva Conventions have been universally ratified, the three Additional Protocols have been ratified by 174, 169 and 79 States, respectively.</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> </span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span> </span>He encouraged all States yet to accede to or ratify such instruments to do so soon.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Similarly, the representative of the European Union, speaking in its capacity as observer, noted that </span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">two Additional Protocols adopted to formulate more robust protection for victims of international and non-international armed conflicts were not universally ratified.<span>  </span>She underscored the importance of training and education on international humanitarian law and referred to a number of training modules to national armed forces in Mali, Central African Republic, Somalia and Mozambique.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">In this regard, Brazil’s representative said that </span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brazil</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">ian Armed Forces are professionally trained in the application of the rules of the international humanitarian law at all levels, including through special courses for officials deployed in United Nations peacekeeping operations. <span> </span>He also noted that </span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brazil</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> works to alleviate the suffering of people displaced by armed conflict and political instability who seek safety within its borders,</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> </span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">including migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The representative of Saudi Arabia, expressing concern about the non-respect of a number of principles of international humanitarian law, including attacks against civilian installations by the Houthi forces, who are also using children in combat, underscored her country’s commitment to protect children in armed conflict. <span> </span>To that end, Saudi Arabia was providing assistance to 86 countries with a total budget of more than $6</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> </span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">million.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Also speaking on UNCITRAL’s report on the work of its fifty-fifth session were representatives of Finland (also for Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden), Singapore, Philippines, Sierra Leone, Belarus, Italy, United States, Mexico, El</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> </span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Salvador, Pakistan, Peru, Canada, India, Cameroon, China, Cuba, Ecuador, Viet Nam, United Kingdom, Russian Federation, Thailand, Dominican Republic, Republic of Korea, France, Argentina, Morocco and Honduras, as well as a representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer. </span></span></p>

<p><u><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Introduction to Report</span></u></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">IVAN ŠIMONOVIĆ (Croatia), Chair of the fifty-fifth session of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), introduced the Commission’s report (document </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://undocs.org/A/77/17"><span>A/77/17</span></a></span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">) and noted that the Commission finalized three legislative texts: <span> </span>a draft convention on the international effects of judicial sales of ships; recommendations to assist mediation centres and other interested bodies with regard to mediation under the UNCITRAL mediation rules (2021); and the Model Law on the Use and Cross-border Recognition of Identity Management and Trust Services. </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Detailing the texts on the judicial sales of ships, he said that the harmonized regime established by the draft convention will be significant, as it offers adequate legal certainty and protection for purchasers.<span>  </span>This would positively impact the price realized by a judicial sale to the benefit of both shipowners and creditors, provided that adequate safeguards are implemented and enforced in the conduct of the sale.<span>  </span>Moreover, the draft convention complements other international instruments of the maritime law reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (including its provisions relating to the nationality and status of ships) and promotes institutional cooperation with the International Maritime Organization.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Turning to mediation, he said that the adopted document of recommendations under the UNCITRAL Mediation Rules (2021) provides a comprehensive set of procedural rules to conduct mediation proceedings in the institutional context.<span>  </span>Drawing attention to electronic commerce, he noted that the Model Law on the Use and Cross-border Recognition of Identity Management and Trust Services provided an opportunity to validate the principles and approaches of UNCITRAL, such as non-discrimination, technology neutrality and functional equivalence.</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> <span> </span>It also </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">highlighted the importance of digital identity and authentication of the actors of digital trade and trust services in the digital age. </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">MARVIN IKONDERE (<u>Uganda</u>) urged countries that have used the Model Law to advise the Commission on how States that have not used it can develop its application and domestication.<span>  </span>He also expressed gratitude for the legal guide on the use of distributed ledger systems and the proposed guidance document that could provide explanations useful to commercial operators, especially micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises and operators located in developing countries in assessing whether distributed ledger technology-enabled services addressed their needs, and the impact of the use of such services on their business.<span>  </span>With regard to investor-State dispute settlement reform, he commended progress being made by Working Group III in the third phase of its mandate.<span>  </span>The Draft Code of Conduct in its present condition, he said, is not complete without regulating the conduct of counsel. “As arbitration becomes more international, we must increasingly confront the difficulties that arise from diverging ethical standards in multiple jurisdictions,” he added.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">TAEEUN CHOI (<u>Republic of Korea</u>), said that the key policy task of his country was to improve laws and systems to meet the global standards.<span>  </span>In this regard, a regional centre for Asia and the Pacific was created to raise awareness of UNCITRAL’s standards and to contribute to the adoption of progressive harmonization and unification of international trade law.<span>  </span>Over the past decade, the Centre has become a permanent office and continues to enhance the capacity of Member States and provide legislation support.<span>  </span>Further, the Republic of Korea has actively cooperated with UNCITRAL to facilitate the development of international trade standards in the Asia-Pacific region.<span>  </span>In August, the Government renewed its memorandum of understanding with the Centre to provide financial support to co-host international events such as the Incheon Law and Business Forum, Seoul ADR Festival, UNCITRAL Special Session for Alternative Dispute Resolution and the Commission’s side event on the Law of Digital Trade.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">MOHAMMED HUSSEIN BAHR ALULOOM (<u>Iraq</u>), speaking for the Arab Group, reiterated the importance of humanitarian principles concerning the protection of victims of armed conflicts.<span>  </span>He appealed to all States to fully respect the provisions of the Geneva Convention and the two respective Protocols.<span>  </span>He also expressed concern regarding the situation of the occupied State of Palestine, including East Jerusalem.<span>  </span>The objective of international humanitarian law was to protect those who are not taking part or no longer taking part in a conflict, namely civilians, children, press, medical personnel, the injured and prisoners of war.<span>  </span>He further underscored that Israel has continued its crime relentlessly on the Palestinian people and their land, and stressed the need to take action on the ground that would guarantee independence and sovereignty over the State of Palestine occupied territory.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Also expressing concern regarding the difficult humanitarian situation in the Gaza sector, he noted that most people there suffer because of the collective punishment imposed.<span>  </span>He called on the international community to take responsibility to put an end to the colonizing occupation of Israel.<span>  </span>He also reiterated a request to the Government of Switzerland to hold a conference of the contracting parties to the Geneva Conventions and take legal measures concerning their application, as well as assessing the implementation of the respective declaration adopted by the Conference of the Parties.<span>  </span>He condemned all the measures undertaken by Israel to change the status quo of the occupied Syrian Golan and asked it to withdraw from all occupied Arab territories.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">JULIA FIELDING (<u>Sweden</u>), also speaking for Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway, encouraged States to report on measures to implement the Additional Protocols at the national level and underscored that respecting and upholding international humanitarian law is “more important than ever”.<span>  </span>In the Russian Federation’s ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine – and in other armed conflicts – civilians must not be targeted, and all efforts must be taken to protect them from the harmful effects of military operations.<span>  </span>She also stressed that assistance must be delivered safely to affected populations, stating that it is “unacceptable” that more than 468 aid workers were victims of attacks in 2021.<span>  </span>Security Council resolutions 2573 (2021) and 2601 (2021), demanding that all parties to armed conflict comply with international humanitarian law and condemning attacks against schools and teachers, respectively, are encouraging developments.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">She went on to stress that those who have committed international crimes must be held accountable.<span>  </span>While efforts towards this end must be made primarily at the domestic level, the international community can help with financial and in-kind support, or by exercising universal jurisdiction.<span>  </span>For its part, Sweden has increased its contribution to the International Criminal Court’s fight against impunity through funding and secondment of staff.<span>  </span>Also spotlighting other germane issues, she said that climate change and environmental degradation increase the risk of new conflicts and worsen ongoing ones.<span>  </span>Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway are committed to curbing climate change with ambitious national targets and have made the link between climate and conflict a key priority in the Security Council.</span></p>

<p><span>HEATHER MCINTYRE (<u>Australia</u>), also speaking for Canada and New Zealand, encouraged States that have not yet become parties to the three Additional Protocols to do so as soon as possible.<span>  </span>Many of the rules contained therein reflect rules of customary international law and, therefore, are binding on all parties to armed conflict.<span>  </span>Recent events – such as the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine - serve to remind of the importance of these rules of international law.<span>  </span>She also stressed that actors who violate international humanitarian law must be held accountable, encouraging the International Conferences of the Red Cross and Red Crescent to continue engaging with States on mechanisms to enhance compliance with such law.</span></p>

<p><span>She went on to say that increased implementation of international humanitarian law could be achieved through States taking practical measures to enhance respect for the same.<span>  </span>Such efforts included incorporating such law into their military doctrine, field training and rules of engagement; sharing lessons learned and good practices; and ensuring that national judicial structures are capable of effectively addressing violations of international humanitarian law.<span>  </span>Adding that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) plays a crucial role in promoting and disseminating such law and in working to improve compliance among parties to armed conflicts, she stressed that the countries for whom she speaks will continue working with all States and the ICRC to address pressing challenges in this field.</span></p>

<p><span>INES MATOS (<u>Portugal</u>) observed that achieving effective implementation of the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Convention remains problematic due to both old and new challenges to the protection of victims of armed conflict. In this context, domestic measures were paramount, she said, adding that Portuguese authorities have implemented several measures, such as maintaining a close and fruitful collaboration with the Portuguese Red Cross.<span>  </span>In addition, the country created a national committee on international humanitarian law in 2021, having fulfilled a specific pledge made by Portugal and the Portuguese Red Cross at the thirty-third International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.<span>  </span>The national committee has a broad mandate, she said, noting that it will be a very useful mechanism to disseminate and implement relevant international legal obligations relating to the protection of victims of armed conflict.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">MICHAEL IMRAN KANU (<u>Sierra Leone</u>), highlighting the Secretary-General’s report on the topic, welcomed information submitted by Austria on its continued voluntary financial contributions to institutions such as the Residual Special Court for Sierra Leone; the continued funding of that Court will strengthen the implementation of international humanitarian law.<span>  </span>He went on to detail national legislation that gives domestic effect to the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols, which are the main instruments of international humanitarian law.<span>  </span>Among other provisions, such legislation provides the national armed forces with appropriate training and sets out procedures for punishing violations by the same.<span>  </span>With regard to grave breaches of such law, national law covers not only offenses committed by citizens of Sierra Leone or those committed on its territory, but also extends to persons of whatever nationality committing offenses either within or outside of Sierra Leone.<span>  </span>Further, it provides for the responsibility of military commanders and other superiors for offenses committed by those under their effective command and control, he noted.</span></p>

<p><span>ZACHARIE SERGE RAOUL NYANID (<u>Cameroon</u>) recalled the statement by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia that armed conflict existed whenever armed force was used between States, or protracted conflict existed between a Government and an organized armed group, or between such groups within a State.<span>  </span>However, provisions relating to the status of prisoners of war only applied to individuals participating in international armed conflict.<span>  </span>Those participating in non-international conflicts are at the disposition of the criminal legislation of the country concerned.<span>  </span>He went on to note that provisions within the First Additional Protocol consider all individuals who do not correspond to certain criteria non-combatants who must be protected from the dangers stemming from military operations.<span>  </span>This could lead to misunderstanding, he noted, because the status of civilians is hard to identify in the context of direct, active participation in hostilities by non-uniformed men and women.<span>  </span>This legal gap challenged the application of the law of war.<span>  </span>Therefore, a definition of “active participation in hostilities” was needed to distinguish this from indirect participation.<span>  </span>He added that modern tactics such as cyberattacks demonstrate the intertwined nature of civilian and military activities, making it hard to determine who is taking part in a conflict.</span></p>

<p><span>ADRIAN DOMINIK HAURI (<u>Switzerland</u>) stressed the importance of universal ratification of the Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocols, noting that his country is the depository of these instruments.<span>  </span>While the Geneva Conventions have been universally ratified, the three Additional Protocols have been ratified by 174, 169 and 79 States, respectively.<span>  </span>He encouraged all States yet to accede to or ratify such instruments to do so soon, adding that 2024 will mark the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions.<span>  </span>That anniversary presents an excellent opportunity for States not yet parties to reconsider the possibility of joining the Additional Protocols.<span>  </span>He also called on States parties to the First Additional Protocol that have yet to recognize the competence of the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission to do so.<span>  </span>Switzerland published its first voluntary report on the implementation of international humanitarian law at the national level in 2020.<span>  </span>In that regard, he encouraged States yet to do so to draft such reports, as they can provide inspiration to other States and facilitate the development of common solutions.</span></p>

<p><span>GALA PASTORA MATOS MENÉNDEZ (<u>Dominican Republic</u>) said that, given current global circumstances, the international community must address challenges affecting the protection of humanity as a singular whole.<span>  </span>For its part, the Dominican Republic is a strong supporter of human rights and will work to ensure that the millions affected by armed conflict or other humanitarian emergencies can enjoy optimism and hope and build a better future.<span>  </span>Spotlighting the tragic consequences of the many and different forms of violations of international humanitarian law, she noted that as such violations become more complex, the principles of such laws must be respected by all parties to armed conflict.<span>  </span>In Latin America and the Caribbean, many of the non-traditional forms of violence affecting the region did not exist when the Geneva Conventions were adopted.<span>  </span>While they may not fall within the ambit of international humanitarian law, they nevertheless result in significant humanitarian consequences.<span>  </span>She went on to say that her country is working to increase the capacity of all humanitarian actors — including those in the military — noting that more than 40,000 Dominican soldiers were trained in international humanitarian law between 2001 and 2022.</span></p>

<p><u><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Right of Reply</span></u></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The representative of <u>Venezuela</u>, in exercise of the right of reply, said that the delegate of Brazil was out of order.<span>  </span>The topic under discussion was related to the protection of victims in armed conflict.<span>  </span>Venezuela finds itself in “a perfect peace” today.<span>  </span>There is no armed conflict in Venezuela today despite the efforts of Brazil’s Government to promote not only an interventionist agenda, but a military one.<span>  </span>Brazil’s Government, in only three years, advocated for an armed intervention against Venezuela, from the southern border Venezuela shares with Brazil, by mercenary and terrorist groups.<span>  </span>Noting the increase in the migratory flows of nationals from Venezuela, he said that the underlying cause was the impact of the unilateral coercive measures imposed against his country, which aim to attack its economy and bring about a change of Government in ways contrary to what is indicated in its national Constitution.<span>  </span>Venezuelans who had to emigrate were not met with open arms but rather with discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance. </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The representative of <u>Brazil</u>, responding to his counterpart, said his country received 770,000 Venezuelan refugees on its territory, all of whom were very well received.<span>  </span>In addition, he stressed that Brazil fully respects the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty of other States.<span>  </span>“I have no news whatsoever of military intervention coming from Brazil into territory of Venezuela,” he said.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The representative of <u>Venezuela</u> said that, in the interest of transparency, his country had submitted a communication to the Sixth Committee that contained information being discussed and the statement with regard to the attempt of Brazil in 2017 to intervene in the internal events of Venezuela.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The representative of <u>Brazil</u> welcomed his counterpart’s intention to send a report and reiterated that in his intervention, delivered in a non-aggressive way, he only mentioned facts on an operational outcome that was accessible on a public domain.</span></p>

<p>The World Health Organization’s new report noted that, in this decade, almost 500 million people will develop heart disease, obesity, diabetes or other noncommunicable diseases due to physical inactivity.  If Governments do not urgently encourage more physical activity, costs for this could reach $27 billion annually.</p>
