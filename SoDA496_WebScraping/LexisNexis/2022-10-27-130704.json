And the heavier the rock, the greater the empathy with the mechanics. In Argentina, Norberto Napolitano, the mythical Pappo, was a renowned lover of irons, as well as having been one of the best guitarists in these lands. That same hobby is shared by James Hetfield, voice and leader of Metallica, owner of a collection of cars, among which there are a series of hot-rods that he provided to a Californian museum and which will be put on display for most of the year. The beginning of this event coincides with the release of the musician's book about his passion for engines, called Reclaimed Rust: The Four-Wheeled Creations of James Hetfield.</p><p><br/>That's what the book and the exhibition will be about, the cars that were created by the guitarist and one of the founders of Metallica. It is no coincidence then that \"Fuel\" is one of the songs of this favorite Hetfield band. This is acknowledged in the documentary Some Kind of Monster, published by the band in the years following the edition of the album St. Anger. The subject, from 1997, refers to the passion and excesses that there is usually in the world of bites, where not only you live to the limit because of the recklessness of driving.<br/>Hetfield is expected to be present at the Petersen Automobile Museum as the musician's first public appearance after he was again interned in late September to try to combat his alcohol addiction, which is why the band should have suspend the Oceania (Australia and New Zealand) stretch of the world tour. That same tour will bring the Americans back to Argentina to perform for the seventh time, next April, now at Campo Argentino de Polo.<br/>Metallica's guitarist and leader has a coveted collection of hot-rods. And he exposes them. (AP)<br/>Hetfield was born on August 3, 1963, in California. As a kid he began to show his adoration for cars, so he has in his memory the models of the '60s and '70s, when they exploit the so-called muscle cars (Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro as the ultimate exponents). But he also got used to seeing the so-called hot-rods, cars of the 30s, 40s and 50s turned into mechanical monsters through various customization processes, from the use of more powerful engines and reforms in the bodies that made them a kind of mechanical mutants that generated madness among the Americans.<br/>The 1997 song \"Fuel\" is Hetfield's favorite of Metallica hits.  (Infobae)<br/>When he started making money with Metallica in the mid-1980s (the band was founded in 1981 and his first album, Kill 'Em All, was released in 1983), he also began to acquire many of the cars he now has in his collection, mostly handcrafted to give them a special personality. \"Watching an exhibition of hot-rods is like watching art. You can react as you don't understand what you see, or also how it didn't occur to me to do it. Or you might wonder who can drive that car. So, God bless America, because you can drive on your routes with these cars,\" Hetfield once reflected on the motor culture of Americans.<br/>View this post on Instagram<br/>This was truly another great time of my life, the picture above is of me and James Hetfeild outside the Motorbreath alley at the Orion festival a few years back, it was a great time for myself for James and for the bands asall of the attendees that were able to make it lots of cars lots of music from Metallica to the red hot chili peppers you name it and they were pretty much there, I didn't not that it would be the last one, I express my gratitude to James the rest of Metallica The promoters Q-Prime, C3 and all of the people that show up to support it, I think for the most part all that attended agree, sadly unlikely that will ever happen again, by the way I keep to keep giant final poster that said Motorbreath alley that I bel ieve was designed by James Het field and Dennis Mcphal<br/>A post shared by Rick Dore (@therickdore) on Jul 12, 2019 at 1:44pm PDT<br/>These are some of the cars that will be exhibited from 1 February until 30 October at the Petersen Museum of the Automobile. After the musician's donation was known, the museum reported that the Metallica leader will receive the title of \"founding member\" of the entity, status received by all people who make large donations.<br/>1948 Jaguar \"Black Pearl\"<br/>The Black Pearl, one of the guitarist's award-winning cars. (Petersen Museum) (Ted Seven aka Ted7/)<br/>It's the most coveted in Hetfield's collection. The Californian built this Black Pearl from scratch with the support of custom car manufacturer Rick Dore. He was awarded the 2014 All-American Association of Goodguys Rod &amp;Custom;. It is inspired by the European brands of the 1930s. The chassis is custom built with 1948 Jaguar outer frame rails. On the exterior it is intensely black and features a 375-horsepower Ford V8 engine and a Mustang suspension.<br/>Lincoln Zephyr \"Voodoo Priest\" from 1937<br/>The musician bought the Lincoln from a Vietnam veteran. (Petersen Museum) (Ted Seven aka Ted7/)<br/>This car was designed for Hetfield by the RD Kustoms team, although it has a unique prehistory. It was originally owned by a soldier who fought in Vietnam. Upon returning in 1972, he left his car in the driveway to his mother's house and there he was discovered, decades later, by Hetfield, who ended up buying it. The refurbishment included a low cover cover, custom taillights, double exhaust and brass moldings. Now it sports an apple green paint with chrome accents. Its V12 engine was revitalized with three Stromberg 97 carburetors and one PowerGen from Powermaster. For greater driving comfort, it was provided with automatic transmission.<br/>It's another creation he made with Rick Dore. (Petersen Museum) (Ted Seven aka Ted7/)<br/>Pick up Ford F-100 from 1956<br/>width\"2499\"/&gt;This pick up keeps the color it had when you bought it. (Petersen Museum) (Ted Seven aka Ted7/)<br/>He bought it online from an older person with which he shared tastes, so much so that the van was already painted in the purple color it maintains. In the customization he worked in conjunction with the Workshop Blue Collar Customs. It has a 455ci engine from Oldsmobile, which originally erodes about 370 horsepower, although in this case it was \"touched\" to raise its power. It then has elements of Mustang, Chevy Impala, Chrysler 1960/1961, Ford Thunderbird, a Saturn and a 1953 Buick. What a mutant says.<br/>The F-100 has elements from many cars of different brands. (Petersen Museum) (Ted Seven aka Ted7/)<br/>1961 Lincoln Continental<br/>The Lincoln Continental, a luxury car from the '60s. (Petersen Museum) (Ted Seven aka Ted7/)<br/>A luxury exponent from the '60s. At first glance, he seems to have little intervention from Hetfield and his cronies and may even sound a little bland. But just look carefully and find yourself with details like the side exit exhaust, and how the satin black makes the car look like a brutal metal slab, as the body lines fade into black.<br/>Auburn Speedster \"Slow Burn\" from 1936<br/>The body of this Auburn is fiberglass (Petersen Museum) (Ted Seven aka Ted7/)<br/>Another co-production with Rick Dore. His \"Slow Burn\" featured a supplement of elegance and custom sparkles, sporting a beer-colored paint and unique custom rims, designed by Hetfield himself. To finish its accented custom character, additional nickel-coated accessories were incorporated to create a star appearance. This roadster won the 2010 Goodguy West Coast Custom award for its great beauty and wit.<br/>The Slow Burn is equipped with a Chevy Small Block V8 engine (Petersen Museum) (Ted Seven aka Ted7/)<br/>1937 Ford Coupe \"Crymson Ghost\"<br/>The Ford coupe was revolutionary in its time, the late 1930s. (Petersen Museum) (Ted Seven aka Ted7/)<br/>Hot-rod fans encountered few models of the 1937 Ford Coupe that had undergone a transformation, although, by its shape, it clearly lends itself to customizing it. It was perhaps also why Hetfield joined Rick Dore again to customize this kind of \"ugly duckling\". And that's why it's going to be one of the sensations that will be on display in Los Angeles.<br/>Petersen)\" height\"590\" src\"\" width\"1049\"/&gt;Hetfield's hot-rod is one of the few in the world. (Petersen Museum) (Ted Seven aka Ted7/)<br/>Packard \"Aquarius\" 1934<br/>The Packard Aquarius is one of the most accomplished in the musician's collection. (Petersen Museum) (Ted Seven aka Ted7/)<br/>Little has this car to do with the original models of the 1930s. An obvious proof of all the work Hetfield and his team do to truly customize these vehicles to achieve the characteristics of what is supposed to be a vehicle owned by the Leader of Metallica. It has a very high resolution of the hidden wheels.<br/>The wheels, almost invisible, give it a futuristic touch. (Petersen Museum) (Ted Seven aka Ted7/)<br/>Ford Iron Fist Coup\u00e9, 1936<br/>This Ford is made of stainless steel and that's its color. (Petersen Museum) (Ted Seven aka Ted7/)<br/>Hetfield turned to Blue Collar Customs to customize it. First he cut it and installed a new air suspension system. The roof cover was then added and a new rounded corner was manufactured for the trunk. The initial plan included black paint, the most relentless color to reveal faults or ripples in the body. Finally it was decided to keep it in bare metal, to show the transition process between the old and the new. It was equipped with the steering of a '52 Chevy, with a drop made of an old aluminum crank. All the inner brilliance has a nickel patina instead of chrome and is complemented by the oxblood leather upholstery and shiny black paint.<br/>It's an Oval, but it has Chevrolet elements, such as direction. (Petersen Museum) (Ted Seven aka Ted7/)<br/>Buick Skylark Skyscraper, 1953<br/>This Buick is one of the most coveted in the guitarist's collection. (Petersen Museum) (Ted Seven aka Ted7/)<br/>It was based on an experimental Buick sports prototype: the XP-300. It was one of the most expensive models in the brand's catalogue and today it is an object of desire coveted by collectors with high purchasing power. Built as a convertible and based on the Roadmaster transmission, it was a favorite car of the stars of the 50s and 60s; Milton Berle, Bob Hope and Jackie Gleason were some of the best-known celebrities who drove him. Only 1,690 units were manufactured, increasing their market price. In2006, one was sold for $375,000, although the world record price for one is $485,000.<br/>Nearly half a million dollars were paid for such Buick models. (Petersen Museum) (Ted Seven aka Ted7/)<br/>Hetfield credits having \"300 guitars and 30 cars, which are many\". In addition to the hot-rods, it also has muscle cars, among them a 1967 Chevrolet Camaro that was used in the video clip of the song \"I Disappear\", composed by Metallica for the soundtrack of the film Mission Impossible 2. But this sports car is no longer in his garage: the musician auctioned it off in 2003 to raise funds for music programs from several schools.<br/>\"Building cars will always be an escape route. I don't know what I'm going to do. Cars are like people to me; they like love. They like you to touch them, they like you to drive them... they love to belook at them. It's a form of expression and freedom.\" This is how Hetfield defined his passion for this particular facet of mechanics. And it's that way a billionaire, who is credited with a fortune of more than $300 million, and can buy the car he wants, prefers to recycle and reconvert old cars to his liking.<br/>I KEPT READING<br/>The cursed car: the story of the super sports car that handled a celebrity and can't find a buyer<br/>How to build a dream: this is how the most powerful Ferrari in history is made<br/>The story of the legendary Mustang that shone in the cinema and just sold at a record price<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-10581959</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3N-V961-JBJN-M504-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1959\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>autos</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U6N</classCode><className>POP &amp; ROCK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000CNQR</classCode><className>CAR ENTHUSIASTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DL5G</classCode><className>HOBBIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DPIO</classCode><className>ADDICTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000066</classCode><className>ALCOHOL ABUSE &amp; ADDICTION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N712110MM</classCode><className>MUSEUMS &amp; GALLERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000138</classCode></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC351</classCode><className>NEW ZEALAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC337</classCode><className>ARGENTINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>GR156</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA &amp; NEW ZEALAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>GT116</classCode><className>OCEANIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>\r\n","Citation":""

And you may have followed his progressively more bizarre fusillade of video messages suggesting that he had been anointed as a saviour to the world from the plague that has outwitted all other forces. The thought may have occurred to you as it did to me, \"Those that the gods would destroy they first make mad.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But even in a moment that might invite a smug sense of satisfaction on our side of the Atlantic (\"Well, at least our leaders aren't demonstrably insane\"), we might stop to consider what more subtle forms irrationality can take. In our own quiet British way, have we gone mad too? Are we not accepting (or being forced to accept) what would have at one time clearly been seen as unproven, unsupported declarations from authorities being dictated by a handful of unelected officials whose analysis is contentious within their own professional fields? Perhaps there is something bigger and more alarming going on here - more alarming even than the idea that the most powerful country in the world is being led by a crazy person.</p><p>Our governing system - indeed, our Western political culture - is based on the idea that the people as a whole can make rational decisions; that through open debate and argument based on agreed principles we can arrive at socially acceptable policy. This has generally been taken to mean that those in authority must address public criticism, offer credible evidence for controversial judgments, and respect the views of those who have been elected to represent the voters.</p><p>Without those assumptions, the whole edifice of modern democracy collapses. In the United States, the worry is that demagoguery and superstition might undermine this idea. But there is something happening here - without the absurd showmanship and the obvious irresponsibility - that is fundamentally disturbing as well: it is more serious ultimately than the immediate threat to sectors of the economy.</p><p>The narrow pursuit of a single strategy on preventing the spread of Covid, engineered by officials and apparently uncritically (some might say, blindly) adopted by the Government, could be unfortunate enough in its practical consequences. But more significant, and more damaging to our long-term national life, is the rejection of that seminal, axiomatic truth that is at the heart of a free society: that anyone making public policy must be expected to defend his position in a way that stands up to examination.</p><p>Here is an example of how not to do this: when Professor Chris Whitty appeared before MPs and local political leaders last week, he was presented with the fact that in a majority of those areas which had been under strict lockdown measures, case numbers had continued to soar. His response to this was to say that without the lockdown, it could have been so much worse.</p><p>Could it? How do we know that? How could we (or he) possibly know it? It is pure conjecture. And on the basis of a supposition - which is in turn based on a contentious hypothesis - the economy of large parts of the North of England may be sunk.</p><p>Of course, the Whitty proposition might be correct. But as he has framed it, it cannot be disproved or even criticised. And that is the real, substantial threat to our politics. What has happened to the intellectual confidence of the Western idea that we are (or should be) robust enough to take on an opponent and defend a position with thoroughness and verifiable information? Where is the tacit assumption that if we are not so robust, we should not be entitled to hold a position of power? That the most important qualification for public authority is that we accept the need to make a case for a decision that is plausible enough to stand up to challenge? This is what politics in a free country is supposed to consist of, isn't it? That's what distinguishes it from totalitarian regimes in which those in power never have to defend their claims.</p><p>Tory backbenchers tell me that they have given up trying to discuss these matters with Boris Johnson because he simply will not entertain the possibility that the Whitty approach might be flawed, or even susceptible to critical reservations. His commitment to lockdown as the only possible solution is, one said, \"ideological\". Ministers at the Department of Health, from the secretary of state down, toe this line with absolute fidelity - presumably because they know that they are licensed to do so by their prime minister. But Conservatives are supposed to be non-ideological. That is their great advantage when the country is threatened by extremism or divisiveness: that their virtues are allegedly the quintessential British traits - pragmatism, fair-mindedness and reasonableness in argument.</p><p>So what is going on? Has the party leadership had a collective nervous breakdown in the face of a challenge that is more incomprehensible and unpredictable than any foreign enemy or internal subversion? Perhaps. Or maybe this is bigger yet. Maybe it goes beyond our local problem of leadership paralysis. After all, this crisis looks like taking down a whole generation of Western political leaders.</p><p>Most Western countries have seen their governments flounder, losing the support of their populations in a miasma of recrimination. There is a collapse of confidence in the ability of Reason - once assumed to be the answer to any societal problem - to cope. Once we might have taken for granted the notion that those in charge had good grounds for doing what they did, and that they would feel obliged to present those grounds on demand. What happened to that? It has been replaced by differing forms of irrationality: maniacal superstition in the US version, and here at home, unquestioning obedience to something called \"The Science\" whose disregard for argument is perversely unscientific.</p><p>Eventually we will recover from the pandemic and its aftermath. But I'm not sure we will ever get back the belief we once had in an open society and its willingness to pursue the truth.</p><p>read more at </p><p>'Tory backbenchers have given up trying to discuss these matters with Boris Johnson because he simply will not entertain the possibility that the Whitty approach might be flawed'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUTELE-163845658</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUTELE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:611T-MFK1-JCBW-N0S9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334988</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1057\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"58170\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 11, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002003</classCode><className>ELECTIONS &amp;

We've always had a peaceful transition of power. It's not going to change,\" said Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who has been an occasional critic of the President.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While Republicans insisted there would be a peaceful transition, many did not go so far as to explicitly criticize his remarks after Trump on Wednesday would not commit to providing a peaceful transition of power after Election Day, lending further fuel to concerns he may not relinquish his office should he lose in November.</p><p>House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy on Thursday insisted there will be a peaceful transition, but also suggested he is not concerned by the remarks. </p><p>\"Let me be very clear to you: It'll be peaceful,\" McCarthy said, adding, \"no questions, no qualms, no concerns, it's going to be peaceful.\"</p><p>Trump's comments amounted to a familiar pattern on Capitol Hill: Stoking a controversy, and putting Republicans in a jam. But this time, he stoked fears about a basic tenet of democracy, forcing Republicans to weigh in and insist the election results will be adhered to -- even if many didn't want take him on by name.</p><p>The No. 2 Senate Republican, John Thune of South Dakota, told CNN that he and other Republicans would stand up to Trump if he tried an extra-constitutional power grab. </p><p>\"Republicans believe in the rule of law, we believe in the Constitution, and that's what dictates what happens (in) ... our election process and so yes,\" Thune said when asked if he is confident that Republicans would not permit a non-peaceful transfer power to occur. </p><p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rarely weighs in on controversial Trump comments, but did so on Thursday, although he didn't single out the President.</p><p>\"The winner of the November 3rd election will be inaugurated on January 20th. There will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792,\" McConnell, who is running for reelection this cycle in Kentucky, tweeted Thursday morning.</p><p>Mitt Romney of Utah, the lone Senate Republican to break ranks and vote to convict during the President's impeachment trial, however, went the furthest and was sharply critical of the President's message, though he did not refer to him by name in his response.</p><p>\"Fundamental to democracy is the peaceful transition of power; without that, there is Belarus. Any suggestion that a president might not respect this Constitutional guarantee is both unthinkable and unacceptable,\" Romney tweeted Wednesday evening, referencing the disputed presidential elections in Belarus.</p><p>Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate GOP leadership team, told CNN it was not appropriate for Trump to refuse to commit to a peaceful transition of power. \"No,\" Cornyn said when asked if it was appropriate. Asked if the GOP would do something about it if he won't leave office if he loses, Cornyn said: \"I'm not going to answer a hypothetical.\"</p><p>Sen. Susan Collins, who is facing a competitive reelection fight in Maine, said that while she has concerns about the comments, she is \"confident that we will see it occur once again.\"</p><p>\"I don't know what his thinking was, but we have always had a controlled transition between administrations. And I'm certain that if there's a change in administrations, that we have the calmness as well. It's fundamental to our democracy,\" she said.</p><p>A number of other Republicans, though, did not sound alarmed at the President's remarks, while still arguing that the threat raised by them will not come to fruition. </p><p>Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, in a difficult reelection race in South Carolina, said: \"It will happen,\" referring to an orderly transition. \"I'm not worried about that. It's the least of my concerns.\"</p><p>Graham said: \"If there's a court challenge to the election, it will be decided in court. And the loser of the challenge will accept the results.\"</p><p>When asked about concerns they are pushing a Supreme Court nominee now to help tilt the outcome of any election results, Graham said: \"We need a full court.\"</p><p>\"There will be a peaceful transition of power, it may take the court process to run its course, but there will be a peaceful transition of power,\" said Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri.</p><p>Sen. Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican and the former Intelligence Committee chairman, dismissed the question put to Trump as an effort \"to get him to say there's a chance I might lose. Why would any candidate say that?\" </p><p>\"I think that anybody that feels that there's a fault in the election would test it,\" Burr said, pointing to Bush v. Gore. \"But at the end of the day, we have protocols for this.\"</p><p>A number of Republicans were quick to deflect, pointing to Hillary Clinton's remarks suggesting that Joe Biden \"should not concede under any circumstances\" though Clinton's remarks were in reference to the possibility that initial results, if close, could change given a surge in mail-in ballots this year.</p><p>McCarthy said on Thursday, \"I hope you ask the same question of Hillary Clinton who simply said out there, never concede the race\" </p><p>North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, one of the most vulnerable Republicans up for reelection this cycle, said: \"Look, there's going to be an orderly transition of power but if you've got spare time today go ask to every Democrat member and ask them if they stand with Hillary Clinton who says that Biden shouldn't accept the result under any circumstances if he doesn't win.\"</p><p>Pressed on whether Trump should accept the results and commit to a peaceful transition, Tillis said: \"Get back with me when you have spoken with the Democratic members on somebody who first said don't accept the result of the election.\"</p><p>Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, similarly focused on Clinton and Biden, saying \"Is your question any different than what Hillary Clinton told Biden: 'don't concede the election.' No, it's very clear whether Biden wins ... this presidency ends on January the 20th under the Constitution.\"</p><p>At the end of August, Clinton said that if the election is close Biden should not concede saying: \"Joe Biden should not concede under any circumstances because I think this is going to drag out, and eventually I do believe he will win if we don't give an inch and if we are as focused and relentless as the other side is.\"</p><p>Trump has previously refused to say whether he would accept the election results, echoing his sentiments from 2016. And he has joked -- he says -- about staying in office well past the constitutionally bound two terms. But his refusal to guarantee a violence-free transition went further and is likely to alarm his opponents, already on edge given his deployment of federal law enforcement to quell protests in American cities.</p><p>House GOP conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, tweeted in response, \"The peaceful transfer of power is enshrined in our Constitution and fundamental to the survival of our Republic. America's leaders swear an oath to the Constitution. We will uphold that oath.\"</p><p>Acting Senate Intelligence Chairman Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, tweeted, \"As we have done for over two centuries we will have a legitimate &amp; fair election It may take longer than usual to know the outcome, but it will be a valid one And at noon on Jan 20, 2021 we will peacefully swear in the President.\"</p><p>This story has been updated with additional developments on Thursday.</p><p>CNN's Haley Byrd, Kristin Wilson, Lauren Fox, Ted Barrett, Kevin Liptak and Nicky Robertson contributed to this report. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

A summary of the ban is available on AILA's website.</p><p>AILA President Marketa Lindt noted, \"The crisis that has gripped the nation and the world demands rational, thoughtful, fact-based policies focused on keeping Americans healthy and our economy strong. The Presidential Proclamation does not move us toward those goals. It disregards the importance of family to those who go to work every day on the frontlines of this crisis, and the importance of workers from all backgrounds and all skill levels in rebuilding our economy. We know from empirical evidence that immigrants create jobs, innovate, start companies, and meet workforce needs. We don't need to suspend immigration, we need to strengthen and improve our immigration system to respond to the challenges of our times. AILA and its members have called for immigration reform for years, asking for a rational and flexible set of policies that drive innovation, support economic growth and uphold our nation's fundamental values. We have never needed that more than today.\"</p><p>AILA Executive Director Ben Johnson added, \"Rather than a thoughtful approach to adjusting our nation's immigration system, the president has chosen to block citizens and residents from being with their family members to support each other during this crisis. All of us, newcomers and native-born alike, will overcome the difficult challenges we face today through hard work and the support of our families. This proclamation will fray and weaken these family support systems when we need them most. Every single one of these blocked visas is a person. The parent of a US citizen who could be caring for her grandchildren to allow someone to work a double shift, or a spouse coming to care for and grieve with a long-term permanent resident facing a terminal illness. These are the types of harms that will come from this proclamation. No American job will be saved, and no one will be safer or more secure. America is better than this.\"</p><p>The American Immigration Lawyers Association is the national association of immigration lawyers established to promote justice, advocate for fair and reasonable immigration law and policy, advance the quality of immigration and nationality law and practice, and enhance the professional development of its members.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123646991</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YRM-PST1-DYTH-G1HY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"421\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It provides services such as product design, website design, computer-aided design, app development, and more.</p><p>We had this crazy idea to start a company, said CEO Djuan Gayle, a senior majoring in computer engineering. Were going to a technology school and we want to change the world, so why not be able to put all of that under a company and just make it happen.</p><p>That crazy idea and the companys willingness to take on unusual projects are reflected in its name.</p><p>Recent Madd Technologies projects have included the design of a university app, and the design of a smart refractometer to measure grapes for peak ripeness for a client in the wine industry.</p><p>In addition to providing technology services for local businesses, Madd Technologies is working on developing its own products, such as an algorithm that uses artificial intelligence to recommend clothing to customers.</p><p>When youre an engineer, everyone in the industry is looking for experience and as a student it can be difficult to gain that experience, said Jaimie Davis, a junior electrical engineering major and the companys technology officer. Being a part of this company and working on project management skills and overall communication really helps all of us become better engineers.</p><p>The eight-person company formed in 2018 and found guidance from Justin Heacock, Florida Polys entrepreneurship coordinator.</p><p>Its been a learning curve because its not like were going to business school, and Justin has been really good at helping with that, Gayle said. We go to him and he just finds the time.</p><p>Gayle said the company is hoping to soon grow to about 15 team members and move into an office space in Lakeland and hopes to eventually be located near the University, providing both jobs and internships to other Florida Poly students.</p><p>For the whole four years of college, weve been entrepreneurial-minded, said Logan Carlson, a senior majoring in computer engineering and the companys research and development officer.</p><p>Madd Technologies leadership said they hope other students will see their success and be motivated to follow their own crazy ideas.</p><p>We learn by doing and one of the hallmarks of studying at Florida Poly is being able to get your hands on stuff, Davis said. But being in this company since my freshman year has really given me a lot more than I could ever expect from a college education.</p><p>Students who would like to join Madd Technologies and businesses interested in the companys services can email <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:maddtechnologies1@outlook.com\">maddtechnologies1@outlook.com</email>  2019 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICTMOW-164773026</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICTMOW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0P-WT81-F11P-X4KD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417299</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Global Data Point Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ICT Monitor Worldwide</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35460\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 17, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009HPZ</classCode><className>STUDENTS &amp;

Here's what he said.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'I won</emphasis>' Trump described in-person votes as \"legal\" and mail-in and absentee votes as \"illegal\". Most states have always allowed mail-in ballots, but some relaxed restrictions on who could vote via mail due to the pandemic.\u00a0  \"If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us,\" Trump said. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lost leads</emphasis> \"We were winning in all the key locations by a lot, actually, and then our numbers started miraculously getting whittled away\" Trump said.\u00a0  His lead in Georgia was \"whittled down and now it is getting to a point where I go from winning by a lot to perhaps being even down a little bit\".  \"It is amazing how one-sided the mail-in ballots are,\" he added, seeming to forget he discouraged his own voters from using the postal service to vote <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fraud\u00a0</emphasis>and binoculars Trump then alleged that swing states were controlled by the Democrats, which is why his lead had changed.   \"Pennsylvania ... is part of a corrupt Democrat machine. I went to school there and I know a lot about it, it hasn't changed ... it has got worse,\" he said, adding the Democrats have allowed ballots to be received three days after the election and accepted ballots without postmarks.\u00a0  The Supreme Court Pennsylvania can accept ballots postmarked before election day. Those without a postmark will be counted unless there is evidence they were mailed after election day.  \"They are trying obviously to commit fraud and there is no question about that. In Philadelphia, observers are being kept far away, very far away, so far that people are using binoculars to try and see,\" Trump said, before turning to Michigan and Detroit.\u00a0  \"Pollers in Michigan were duplicating ballots ... Detroit is another place and I would not say it has the best reputation for election integrity,\" he said, adding cardboard had been placed over windows to block observes, with \"unexplained\" ballots appearing late.\u00a0  There is no evidence of the fraud Trump alleges has taken place. Two cases of  have been found nationally -- both were Republican votes, with one man in Pennsylvania trying to vote for his mother, and another in Nevada trying to vote twice.\u00a0  Online polls were part of the conspiracy, Trump added.\u00a0  \"Everyone now recognises media polling was election interference in the truest sense of that word by powerful special interests. These really phony polls ... were designed to keep out voters at home, create the illusion of momentum for Mr Biden and diminish Republican's ability to raise funds,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0  \"It is not a question of who wins, Republican, Democrats, Joe, myself, we cannot let [voter fraud] happen to our country.\" <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More litigation</emphasis> Trump flagged further lawsuits in the coming days.\u00a0  \"[There have been] lots of litigations, it is a tremendous, tremendous amount of litigation generally because of how unfair this process was. I have been talking about mail-in voting for a long time and it has destroyed our system. It is a corrupt system and it makes people corrupt even if they are not by nature but they become corrupt,\" he said.\u00a0  Following litigation, Trump claims \"we will win the election very easily\".\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In stark comparison</emphasis> Just over an hour earlier in his home state of Delaware, Democratic nominee Joe Biden gave an  urging calm.  Going from Biden's speech to Trump's is jolting. Biden stuck to his usual reserved and optimistic rhetoric, preaching about togetherness -- and kept his update to two minutes.\u00a0  \"Each ballot must be counted ... Democracy is sometimes messy. It sometimes requires a little patience as well. But that patience has been rewarded now as it has been for 240 years with a system of governance that has been the envy of the world,\" he said.\u00a0  \"I ask all people to stay calm: the process is working, the count is being completed, and we'll know very soon ... We have no doubt that when the count is finished, Senator [Kamala] Harris and I will be winners.\"  He gave the speech after he and Harris attended a virtual briefing on COVID-19 and the economic crisis <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What else happened?\u00a0</emphasis> Two of Trump's lawsuits in Michigan and Georgia to stop ballot counting were dismissed. His campaign had a small win in Pennsylvania though, with Republican observers granted permission to observe from a distance of two meters as officials unpacked and scanned ballots. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:619K-DNK1-JD6R-T2GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"810\"/><timeReceived>12:43:19 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 6, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001812</classCode><className>VOTERS &amp;

There, he tried to inform the guards that he had a message for the president, but they wouldn't listen. Instead he said they chased him around the yard and beat on him as he lingered in pain.</p><p>Mohammed says he has no idea how he entered the President's yard or how he bypassed the security guards.</p><p>President's Office Deny Intruder Entered the House</p><p>Tipped off about the incident, FPA contacted the head of the Executive Protection Services, Mr. Trokon Roberts, who reluctantly acknowledged the incident but resisted persistent inquires to clearly explain what actually happened. \"Yes, a mad man forced his way through security barriers while he was been questioned. He was later arrested and turned over to the police.\"</p><p>When asked whether the man made his way into the President's bedroom and what was the current status of the EPS officers on duty, Mr. Roberts declined to comment further. However, FPA was informed late Monday that because of the incident, the EPS officers assigned at the President's home have all been removed and replaced by soldiers of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) who have been placed on temporary guard duty pending probe of the incident.</p><p>It was not until six days later, that the President's office, following the FPA report, issued a statement of denial, acknowledging that there was an intrusion on the president's home, but it was carried out by a mad man who entered the president's property from the back.</p><p>On Tuesday, the office of the Presidential Press Secretary said: \"The truth is the apparent mentally ill man did not enter the home of H.E. Dr. George Manneh Weah, contrary to the newspaper's publication.\"</p><p>The statement said:</p><p>On the morning of Thursday, April 23, 2020, a man believed to be suffering from mental illness, attempted to make his way into the premises of the President through the rear entrance, but he was spotted and caught at one of the premises security booths by officers of the Executive Protection Services.</p><p>The incident in no way amounts to the apparent mentally ill man's entry of the President's residence as sensationally reported; for the man did not even go beyond the security booth.</p><p>It is hereby clarified that the deployment of a few Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) officers at the home of the President coordination, cooperation and collaboration strategies designed by the joint security during the \"State of Emergency\"</p><p>Furthermore, the deployment of the AFL officers at the home of the President in no way usurps and obviates the functions and duties of the EPS. It is rather complimentary.</p><p>The public is assured that the President of Liberia, Dr. George Manneh Weah, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Liberia is in excellent health.</p><p>As Commander-in-Chief of the AFL, he has the constitutional entitlement to the Army's services. We called on Liberians and residents alike to face, without distractions, the battle against the Coronavirus which has threatened the health, happiness and normalcy of our nation and people and as well refrain from discriminating against people living with mental illness.</p><p>New Images Reveal Extent of Assault on 'Mad Man'</p><p>\"When he started talking about this dream, we tied him up to prevent him from leaving but he broke the door of our home, we tried to run behind him but he outran everybody.

Although Komara's face is not shown, he is heard screaming and languishing in pain.</p><p>FPA has now learned that the victim received more beatings when he was taken to the Central Police headquarters, more painful than what is seen on the video.</p><p>A relative of the victim told FPA that the government is currently trying to reach out to them in hopes of closing the case. \"They want him and his parents to sign a document that he is crazy,\" the source speaking on condition of anonymity said Wednesday.</p><p>Mohammed's brother, Layee says the family is trying to cope and restore their brother back to health. \"We are trying to work on him, he's not too well. He says the genies give him message in his sleep to go deliver the message to the president and that's what why he went there.\"</p><p>Even Layee is unsure how his brother entered the President's fence.</p><p>\"When he started talking about this dream, we tied him up to prevent him from leaving but he broke the door of our home, we tried to run behind him but he outran everybody. He said there were 2000 genies behind him telling him to go and deliver his message to the President,\" Layee said.</p><p>'I'm Not a Mad Man'</p><p>FrontPageAfrica was informed that a glass door in the President's home was also damaged as a result of the intrusion. The President was reportedly at his Jamaica Resort at the time of the incident.</p><p>Still lingering in pain Wednesday, Mohammed says he lost his Koran during the scuffle with the President's guards.</p><p>Asked whether he was a mad man as being claimed by the President's office and the EPS, Mohammed says he is not crazy. \"I drive a taxicab for a living. I have nothing against President Weah. In fact, I supported him during the campaign for president. I used to walk from Doe Community to join the rallies at CDC headquarters. I honestly, did not mean any harm. The genies just came into my dream and took over. I was powerless and lost control of myself.\"</p><p>On his present condition, Layee says he is still in pain. \"It's looking bad. My two hands are in pain, the chain they tied me with entered my flesh. \"I'm not crazy, I just had a dream.

Nobody deserved the break more. After all, it was largely down to his magnificence and majesty over the previous hour that Manchester United were in such control.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scorer of one and the creator of two more, Fernandes is already running the show more impressively than Paul Pogba has this season at least.</p><p>Yes, this was Club Brugge and a 10-man one for most of the game but it was another sign United have a fine player on their hands.</p><p>Fernandes - the \u00a347m signing from Sporting Lisbon - will obviously have to impress against the Premier League big boys rather than a Belgian top-tier outfit to really prove his worth.</p><p>But all the signs here were that he is the creative midfielder Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side have been craving all season.</p><p>What might have come of their campaign if Fernandes arrived in June rather than January is something to consider.</p><p>But he could help them at least finish the season on a high by achieving Champions League qualification in the Premier League - or by winning this trophy, which would also secure their path back into Europe's elite.</p><p>After a hectic start during which both sides could have added to the 1-1 scorean line from the first leg last week in Belgium, United opened the scoring in the 27th minute when Brugge defender Simon Deli decided to turn into a keeper.</p><p>Daniel James's strike was heading for the corner when Deli dived in front of Simon Mignolet and made a save any keeper would be proud of.</p><p>Dutch referee Serdar Gozubuyuk brandished the red card but as Fernandes waited to take his penalty, the VAR got involved to make it even stranger.</p><p>Gozubuyuk had a look at the pitchside monitor and didn't change his mind that he had intentionally denied a goal with his arm.</p><p>Fernandes hopped, skipped and fired home the penalty five minutes after it was awarded.</p><p>United doubled their lead in the 35th minute when Fernandes' beautifully chipped ball found Juan Mata. His first-time ball across the area found Odion Ighalo perfectly placed to score for the club on his first start.</p><p>The tie was then put to bed before the break. Fernandes had poached the ball before laying off to Fred, who in turn teed up Scott McTominay to calmly slot the ball home from 18 yards. And if there was any doubt, substitute Jesse Lingard set up Fred for the fourth with eight minutes to go as the United midfielder tapped home after a cut back from the England man.</p><p>The Brazil midfielder then made it five in injury-time with a fine finish.</p><p>MANCHESTER UNITED (4-2-3-1): Romero 7; Wan-Bissaka 7, Maguire 7, Bailly 8, Shaw 7; Fred 7, McTominay 8 (Greenwood 72); James 7 (Chong 46, 6), FERNANDES 8 (Lingard 65, 6), Mata 8; Ighalo 7.

President Trump is using this impeachment to fire up his supporters. Overnight the President holding his first rally since that inquiry began. His sharpest attacks and some vulgarities leveled against his Democratic rival Joe Biden. Take a listen.</p><p>GRAPHICS: TRUMP LASHES OUT AT RAUCOUS RALLY</p><p>GRAPHICS: PRESIDENT ATTACKS JOE BIDEN &amp; BLASTS \"INSANE WITCH HUNT\"</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (UNITED STATES)</p><p>He was never considered a good senator. He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama's (censored by network)</p><p>CECILIA VEGA (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) All right, so let's bring in our chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl there at the White House. And, Jon, polls show a majority of Americans now support impeachment. The President seems to be feeling the heat there.</p><p>JONATHAN KARL (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) Cecilia, it was quite a performance last night. The President spoke about this impeachment inquiry in almost apocalyptic terms, saying that Democrats and the radical left were trying to destroy American democracy. And he looked out at his supporters and said that what they were trying to do was, quote, \"Erase your vote like it never existed.\" And you played just one clip from the way he went after Joe Biden. But he went on and on in deeply personal ways talking about Biden and his son Hunter, using the kind of language that most people would not let their children use. And regarding the Democratic leaders, he spoke about Nancy Pelosi saying, quote, \"She's either really stupid or she has really lost it.\" So, again, this all coming, as you mentioned, polls are showing increasing public support for the impeachment inquiry.</p><p>CECILIA VEGA (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) Yeah, Jon, we've been talking about this - this week. The White House says it's not going to comply with this investigation on Capitol Hill. That is not stopping Democrats from issuing an onslaught of subpoenas in the last few days including now to the Energy Secretary.</p><p>JONATHAN KARL (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) Energy Secretary Rick Perry is among what I count 11 different subpoenas issued over the past week to State Department officials. Perry, they want to talk to him and get information about his dealings with Ukraine. It's an all-out effort. And the question now, Cecilia, is how hard will the administration work to block this, the testimony of these various officials? As Pierre mentioned, Ambassador Yovanovitch, who is a central figure in all of this, expects to bible to testify this morning, but we just don't know if there will be a last-minute effort to block her.</p><p>CECILIA VEGA (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) We will see, Jon Karl, okay, thanks. George.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCNEW-E892EF76-22E6-4F33-8A98-FA4F32D600A2-4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCNEW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCM-NN61-JC85-K2DM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8277</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"465\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.

The House of Representatives passed articles of of impeachment against Trump Dec. 18 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, but Pelosi said she would not send the articles over until the Senate determined its process for a trial. Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Republicans and Democrats were at an \"impasse.\"</p><p>Democrats accuse Trump of abusing his power by pressuring the government of Ukraine to open politically motivated investigations by withholding nearly $400 million in security assistance and an Oval Office meeting, and of obstructing Congress by stonewalling House Democrats' investigation into Ukraine.</p><p>Trump also wrote that the \"bogus impeachment scam\" has made it \"more difficult\" for him to negotiate with foreign leaders. Trump also continued his attacks on Pelosi's San Francisco district as a \"filthy dirty district\" and \"one of the worst anywhere in the U.S. when it comes to the homeless and crime.\" He called on Pelosi to clean up the district and help the homeless.</p><p>If she didn't do so, Trump suggested another Democrat should challenge Pelosi in a primary election. A primary challenger to Pelosi faces stiff odds. Pelosi took a commanding lead in her 2018 primary election with 68.5% of the vote and won re-election in November 2018 with 86.8% of the vote. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USATDY-114483238</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XV6-KH81-JC8N-K3B5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"308\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gannett Company, Inc.

Gretchen Whitmer as crazy, saying it was \"disrespectful and unnecessary.\"</p><p>The Collegian at Hillsdale College quoted Senate Majority Mike Shirkey's comments to Republican students last week. He combined the word \"bat\" and an obscenity while saying Whitmer and Democratic lawmakers are on the \"crazy spectrum.\"</p><p>\"I reached out to Governor Whitmer directly and apologized for my comments,\" Shirkey said in a written statement. \"I regret what I said. In times of peak frustration we often say things we don't mean, but that's no excuse for my offensive statement. It was disrespectful and unnecessary.\"</p><p>The newspaper also reported Thursday that Shirkey called Whitmer's budget vetoes and unilateral fund transfers \"rash political misbehaviour.\"</p><p>Whitmer is in Israel on a trade trip, while legislators are taking a multi-week break for deer hunting and Thanksgiving. Whitmer spokesman Zack Pohl called Shirkey's comments sexist and likened him to President Donald Trump, saying \"it seems clear that women in power make the Senate majority leader very uncomfortable.\"</p><p>Lonnie Scott, executive director of the liberal group Progress Michigan, called Shirkey's behaviour \"inappropriate, highly sexist and completely out of line. This isn't how the leader of Michigan's Senate should be speaking to anyone, let alone a group of students.\"</p><p>Whitmer and the GOP-controlled Legislature have been at odds during a budget impasse that culminated with her vetoing nearly $1 billion in proposed funding on Sept. 30 and shifting more than $600 million within department budgets on Oct. 1.

If I go out there tomorrow and shoot another 68, I won't be too far away</p><p>\"From watching the early starters I felt the key today was to try to play the first five holes in even par, then in the middle section of the round you could make a couple of birdies, and try to hang on coming in.</p><p>\"I executed the game plan really well. I relied on my short game when I had to, and made some nice putts. Geez, I think anything under par on this golf course today is a really good score.</p><p>\"And now I feel like I'm right back in it. I feel for anyone who is within six shots of the lead going into the final round, that's not a lot on this golf course. I don't think that's out of it by any stretch of the imagination.</p><p>\"Someone gets off to a decent start - hopefully me - maybe one or two under through five and then the leader goes the other way, one or two over through five, and all of a sudden you're right in the thick of things.</p><p>\"We'll see what happens, but I definitely feel like I've got a pretty good shot.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNONL-66118156</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WB-2611-JBNF-W45V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">442885</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"544\"/><timeReceived>12:34 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 NEWS GROUP NEWSPAPERS LTD All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thesun.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26461\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 20, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper; Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000800</classCode><className>GOLF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A2IA</classCode><className>GOLF TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001407</classCode><className>PROFESSIONAL SPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001735</classCode><className>TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000327</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY SPORTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000327</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY SPORTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>PE0009TGV</classCode><className>TIGER WOODS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DIJB</classCode><className>RORY MCILROY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>\r\n","Citation":""

The tweetbomb prompted observers to wonder whether Sanders was getting under the president's skin[4]\u2015 a notion later floated by the senator himself.In one tweet, Trump predicted that Sanders and 'Sleepy Joe Biden[5]' would be the top contenders for the Democratic[6] nomination for president in 2020.'I look forward to facing whoever it may be. May God Rest Their Soul!'</p><p> Trump declared, without explaining his use of the apparently morbid phrase.Trump also took aim at Sanders' income as well as the senator's Monday interview on Fox News, in which Sanderslambasted the president as a 'pathological liar.'[7]Trump said it was 'weird' to watch Sanders on his preferred news network and suggested, without evidence, that Fox News had prevented Trump supporters from entering the studio.So weird to watch Crazy Bernie on @FoxNews[8]. Not surprisingly, @BretBaier[9] and the 'audience' was so smiley and nice. Very strange, and now we have @donnabrazile[10]? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2019[11] Many Trump Fans ...gns were outside of the @FoxNews[12] Studio last night in the now thriving (Thank you President Trump) Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for the interview with Crazy Bernie Sanders. Big complaints about not being let in-stuffed with Bernie supporters. What's with @FoxNews[13]? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2019[14] Bernie Sanders and wife should pay the Pre-Trump Taxes on their almost $600,000 in income. He is always complaining about these big TAX CUTS, except when it benefits him. They made a fortune off of Trump, but so did everyone else - and that's a good thing, not a bad thing! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2019[15] I believe it will be Crazy Bernie Sanders vs. Sleepy Joe Biden as the two finalists to run against maybe the best Economy in the history of our Country (and MANY other great things)! I look forward to facing whoever it may be. May God Rest Their Soul! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2019[16] Reacting to Trump's Twitter tirade, Sanders said Tuesday night that the president appeared to be 'scared of our campaign.'Sanders has emerged as the leader of the Democratic presidential fundraising pack, with $18.2 million raised so far this year. According to a March poll by Fox News, both Sanders and former Vice President Biden are more popular[17] among voters than Trump.Looks like President Trump is scared of our campaign.

It's really all about these wonderful football players. </p><p>\"The gap is so insane, I don't really understand it. I'm not smart enough. I've not had that before. It's outstanding, it's so difficult. I go back into the changing room and we chat about the things and then I'm like 'oh, but congratulations. We won the game, another three points'.\"The result leaves Daniel Farke's Norwich rooted to the bottom of the table, six points behind 19th-placed Watford. They look set for an immediate return to the Championship despite their battling performance.Klopp brought back midfielder Naby Keita for his first start in a Premier League match since December and Mane was on the bench as Liverpool started full of confidence.The visitors controlled possession in the early stages without creating many clear-cut openings but Norwich managed some brief spells of attractive passing football themselves.Liverpool forward Roberto Firmino was particularly impressive, producing an exquisite piece of skill to control a long Jordan Henderson pass before the ball was stolen off his toes as he shaped to shoot.But Farke's men kept Liverpool quiet and came close to snatching the lead themselves. Sadio Mane scored the winner for Liverpool against Norwich Photo: AFP / Oli SCARFF Lukas Rupp got in behind the Liverpool defence and controlled a long ball over the top. He opted to pass to his left to Teemu Pukki but Alisson Becker produced a superb save, clawing the ball away at the feet of the Finnish striker.Liverpool were quickly on top again in the second half but struggled to create clear chances until Keita tested Tim Krul from distance in the 58th minute.The Anfield giants laid siege to the Norwich goal but frustration mounted as the home side somehow kept the score at 0-0.Keita should have done better when he reacted quickly to a rebound off Krul but the goalkeeper dived to his right to deny the Guinea international.Alexander Tettey almost caught Becker out on a rare Norwich foray into the Liverpool half, thundering a shot against the near post as the home crowd roared their team on.Just when it seemed Norwich could become only the second team this season, after Manchester United, to deny Liverpool all three points, Mane broke the deadlock.The second-half substitute controlled a long ball from Henderson with his right foot in the 78th minute before lashing home with his left.Defending champions Manchester City, reeling from a two-season European ban for breaching fair play rules, are in second place in the table but have no chance of winning a third straight title.European champions Liverpool can now turn their thoughts to the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Atletico Madrid on Tuesday.jw/dj </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767158181755783625876100043</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y72-N171-F03R-N41R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"650\"/><timeReceived>1:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 16, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0003IIJ</classCode><className>MANCHESTER UNITED PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS711211 SPORTS TEAMS &amp; CLUBS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC7941 PROFESSIONAL SPORTS CLUBS &amp; PROMOTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>MANU (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001407</classCode><className>PROFESSIONAL SPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001587</classCode><className>SOCCER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DMKX</classCode><className>BUSINESS REPORTS &amp; FORECASTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DH0I</classCode><className>NORWICH, ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX476</classCode><className>MANCHESTER, ENGLAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>\r\n","Citation":""

This country cannot be governed by the bunch of crazy people who govern it,\" said da Silva, who is commonly known as Lula, in an interview with the newspapers El Pais and Folha de S. Paulo. \"The country doesn't deserve this and more importantly the people don't deserve this.\"</p><p>The Workers' Party leader has been held in the city of Curitiba since April 2018, after a second court ratified the sentence handed down by former judge Sergio Moro, who is now Brazil's justice minister. Da Silva was convicted of corruption and money laundering over a beachfront apartment that prosecutors say he received from a construction company in exchange for lucrative government contracts.</p><p>\"I am obsessed with unmasking judge Moro and those who sentenced me. I want to expose the farce that was mounted in the Justice Department of the United States,\" asserted the ex-president in the first interview to be authorized by authorities since he was jailed.</p><p>Tuesday, in a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court reduced the penalty of the former president from 12 years to eight years and 10 months. If he doesn't receive any new sentences before then, he could enter a semi-open prison regime in September.</p><p>Although he focused his criticism on Moro, Brazil's former president was also found guilty by a second court and also by the Supreme Court.</p><p>\"I know very well my place in history.

The product basket has increased by 12 percent in such a short period of time!</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Our reporter did his shopping in the Spo\u0142em store in one of Warsaw's housing estates, which he has been monitoring since October last year. Yesterday tomatoes were twice as expensive as at the end of February. He paid one third more for poultry meat and cheese, sugar and flour were more than 20 percent more expensive! There was no cheap tea in it, because it was bought out. The prices of all purchased products are shown in the box next to the text. More than half of them have gone up! Why?</p><p>Traders explain that the prices are being driven up by suppliers who have realised that the Poles, scared by the virus pandemic, have started to stock up on food en masse in recent days. This is why meat has become so expensive in small local and family shops.</p><p>- The situation in the wholesale trade is stabilising and prices will start to fall soon - we heard in the shop where we made a buy-ops.

The baton was always going to be passed via the Old Etonian networks, with Theresa May ultimately there as the fall-girl, giving the Tories a free pass to a far-right regime that makes Thatcher look like Clement Attlee.</p><p>Anyone watching Johnson's performance in the BBC debate last week could see why he 'empty chaired' the previous C4 debate. It showed a man of entitlement - devoid of the personality and charisma that so often is referenced as his main asset. He looked bored and frustrated that he should have to debate and fight for a job that by birth-right he probably feels is his.</p><p>His lack of intellect and smarts leaves us with a pound-shop Donald Trump presiding over the UK at its most fragile time. On the brink of recession due to the Brexit deadlock, with everything to play for, Johnson is woefully out of his depth as a leader. 'Boris' is the absolute definition of a career politician, motivated by nothing but his own self-interest. Let's remember the poster boy for Vote Leave who wrote two articles prior to the referendum launch; one to stay and one to leave. He made his choice on the basis of what would be best for his career and the quickest route to the top job in No 10.</p><p>His narcissism and racism are disguised as bumbling gaffes - and his incompetence during his short time as Foreign Secretary has left Nazanin Zaghari-Radcliffe still behind bars in Iran. But the likes of Johnson will never be judged on his suitability for the job. The old boys' network long ago decided who the next Prime Minister is. And its excruciating for any sane person that doesn't vote Tory, to see this Vaudeville version of X-Factor played out in the media for another month.</p><p>In another place and time, Tory members may have chosen the boring and safe bet of Jeremy Hunt. But the world of post-truth demands an irrational leader for irrational times. And so, while the result of this faux 'leadership race' between Johnson and Hunt is totally inevitable, the future for us all has never looked more uncertain.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LDECHO-150427988</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LDECHO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDB-MX11-DYTY-C4KD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">245285</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"386\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Liverpool Echo</publicationName><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 23, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp;

The statement, jointly issued by Parti Amanah Negara (Amanah) president Mohamad Sabu and Democratic Action Party (DAP) secretary-general Lim Guan Eng on Monday (Jun 22), came amid a difference of opinion within PH over the candidates for the prime minister post. \"We have been criticised for not quickly regaining our rightful government and yet when we find the only realistic route left for success we are criticised as power crazy. This is unfair because while we are not afraid to be in opposition, the rakyat (people) voted for us in 2018 to be in government,\" the statement read. </p><p>PH was voted into Putrajaya in the 2018 general election with Dr Mahathir at the helm, but the administration collapsed in February after Mr Muhyiddin Yassin led Bersatu out of the coalition. Mr Muhyiddin, who is backed by Barisan Nasional and Parti Islam Se-Malaysia, was sworn in as Malaysia's eighth prime minister leading the Perikatan Nasional (PN) pact. PH, which finds itself as the opposition coalition again, was strategising its moves to return to federal power but reached a stalemate when component parties and their allies could not agree over the candidacy for premiership. Amanah and DAP were in favour of bringing Dr Mahathir Mohamad back as prime minister, with Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) president Anwar Ibrahim as his deputy, after Mr Anwar failed to convince the ruling state coalition in Sarawak to back him for the top post. PKR, however, has rejected the option and insisted that Mr Anwar should be the prime minister if the coalition recaptures Putrajaya. \"Both DAP and Amanah have worked strenuously during the last three months to find a common ground acceptable to all but unfortunately it has not been successful. \"We hope that PKR and Tun (Mahathir) together with Warisan will not drift further apart but instead continue to move closer together. Seeing each other as rivals instead of allies will not help the rakyat's (people's) cause and only aid those who successfully deposed an elected government with an unelected one,\" the statement read. Warisan refers to Parti Warisan Sabah. \"Only when we are all on the same page together can we ensure that PH can reclaim the rakyat's government,\" it added. READ: KL High Court dismisses Mahathir's application for interim injunction to be recognised as Bersatu chairman Disclosing the internal discussions leading to them choosing Dr Mahathir over Mr Anwar, Amanah and DAP said they have been consistently supporting Mr Anwar as the prime minister since 1998 and will continue to do so. However, the only realistic option of success in the current political scenario is to combine the strength of all five parties, namely PKR, Amanah and DAP in PH as well as Warisan and Dr Mahathir's faction of Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu), they added. \"This political journey has taken 22 years, we can afford to wait another six months to see Datuk Seri Anwar installed as the 10th prime minister of Malaysia. The six months transition shall be documented in writing, signed by all party leaders and publicly announced,\" the statement read. In their Monday statement, Amanan and DAP said even though Dr Mahathir, Warisan and PKR cannot agree with each other, all parties must try to find a common ground to recover the electoral mandate won in the 2018 general election. The two parties said they are preparing for snap polls while continue to be the \"people's voice and defender\" at the time of an economic crisis caused by the pandemic. \"We shall also mobilise our party machinery to prepare for the possibility of snap general elections and work together with all political parties opposed to the PN government,\" the statement read. WE CANNOT TRUST MAHATHIR 100 PER CENT: ANWAR Separately, Mr Anwar, in a Facebook Live on Sunday, revealed that there are elements of distrust among PH over Dr Mahathir being the coalition's candidate for the prime minister post again. He said the very fact that an agreement had to be signed for Dr Mahathir to stay in power for six months meant there was suspicion. \"We already had experience, so we cannot trust (him) 100 per cent,\" he said, adding that Dr Mahathir had delayed the handover of the prime minister position to him following the 2018 elections, even though an agreement was in place. Mr Anwar said it would be very difficult for him to take on the deputy prime minister post with Dr Mahathir at the helm. \"I joked with my friends, how long must I suffer? Enough is enough,\" he said. Mr Anwar was formerly Dr Mahathir's deputy prime minister in the 1990s under the previous Barisan Nasional administration. He was sacked by Dr Mahathir in 1998 and was jailed for corruption and sodomy, charges he maintained were politically motivated.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12858144</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6066-XJF1-JCDN-1116-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"832\"/><timeReceived>8:06 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

But, they should have visited to console the rain-affected people when the city witnessed heavy floods,\" KTR said. </p><p>\"It would have been much better if the same leaders had come to Hyderabad when the city was hit by heavy rains and floods,\" KTR said during a rally in Uppal on Wednesday. Saying that they welcome the top BJP leadership to the state, he said: \"Instead of coming here with empty hands, I urge them to get Rs 1,350 crore financial relief for flood-affected colonies which CM KCR had requested in his letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\"He also asked the central ministers to pay a visit to Durgam Cheruvu bridge, Annapurna centres and Basti Dawakhanas in the city. He said Hyderabad has remained peaceful for the last six years. \"There has not been a single incident of communal tension. Today, they only want to divide people in the name of religion. I urge you all to not support such parties,\" he said. KTR also criticised the BJP leaders for making false promises to voters. \"The BJP leaders are promising to give a financial assistance of Rs 25,000 to flood-affected families. These are the same leaders who were responsible for stopping distribution of financial assistance of Rs 10,000 to the flood-affected people. Now, they are coming up with such promises to fool people,\" he said.Reacting sharply to remarks made by AIMIM leader Akbaruddin Owaisi and BJP state president Bandi Sanjay, KTR said: \"One insane leader says memorials of NTR and PV Narasimha Rao should be bulldozed and another insane leader advises youth for triple-riding and promises GHMC would pay the traffic violation challans.\" He asked, \"Should you vote for such parties?\" In his tweets, KTR said both leaders were the pride of Telugu people.  \"Making remarks on such leaders is not acceptable and there is no place for such comments in a democracy,\" the minister said.The state government kicked off the centenary celebrations of Narasimha Rao in June this year and the state assembly passed a resolution urging the Centre to confer Bharata Ratna on the former PM.He also said Uppal faced a major water crisis till five years ago and people used to get water once in two weeks. \"But today, every house is getting drinking water every alternate day. The TRS government has resolved the water crisis very efficiently,\" he said.

''I think it's crazy. It costs a fortune to operate, and I think it's crazy.'' </p><p>  But he would not say whether he would consider closing the prison at Guant\u00e1namo. ''We're looking at a lot of things,'' he said without elaborating. Instead, he pointed out that his predecessor tried and failed to shutter the prison. ''Look, President Obama said that Guant\u00e1namo Bay would be closed, and he never got it done.''</p><p>  The president's comments came in reaction to a report in The New York Times tabulating the expense of housing the 40 prisoners remaining at Guant\u00e1namo, who include the men accused of plotting the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. According to the report, the government spent more than $540 million last year to hold the prisoners, including pay for the military guards, the cost of the war court and related construction expenses.</p><p>  The cost of $13 million per prisoner almost certainly makes the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo, which was set up by President George W. Bush's administration in the months after 9/11 and became a public relations liability, the world's most expensive prison.</p><p>  [Read The Times's report: Set up nearly 18 years ago, the prison on the remote naval base has grown into what appears to be the most expensive on earth.]</p><p>  By comparison, it cost American taxpayers in 2012 just $78,000 per inmate at the ''supermax'' federal prison in Colorado, where some of the nation's most dangerous prisoners are kept and where some officials in the past have suggested transferring the Guant\u00e1namo detainees.</p><p>  Mr. Bush sought to reduce the population before leaving office and released about 540 detainees, mostly transferring them to home countries like Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Mr. Obama vowed during his 2008 presidential campaign to close Guant\u00e1namo, and his administration released another 200 through a similar approach.</p><p>  But Mr. Obama was blocked by Congress from transferring the remaining detainees to any federal prison in the United States amid resistance to the idea of bringing terrorists to American soil. And when Mr. Trump ran for president in 2016, he vowed to keep Guant\u00e1namo open and even to send more terrorists there, although none have actually been added to the prison since he took office.</p><p>  In his comments to reporters on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump focused more on what to do with prisoners captured during the war with the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq and still held by the United States in the Middle East. The president has demanded that European allies take those prisoners who originally came from their countries. He repeated his threat to release them at the borders of those nations if they do not.</p><p>  ''The big decision we have now is we have thousands of people,'' Mr. Trump said. ''They came from other countries. We want those countries to take them back. We did them a big favor by stopping them. If they came from France, we want France to take them and to try and do whatever they have to do with them. But that's a very expensive situation.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: The detention center at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, which cost about $540 million to operate last year, including construction costs.

The price of Class A drugs, particularly cocaine, has fallen dramatically in the last five or six years. As a result you have seen gangs trying to keep profits up trying to get more and more market share.\" Mr Javid said he would order MPs to rally behind a new withdrawal deal in Commons votes.</p><p>Asked if he would remove the whip from rebels, Mr Javid said: \"You need to look at each case individually, but as a general rule I think we should be tough on those that are not supporting government policy.\" Mrs May was defeated three times in the Commons on her withdrawal agreement, and had to back away from a fourth vote.</p><p>Asked what he would say to the anti-EU European Research Group of rebel MPs, Mr Javid said: \"I think my colleagues understand - having not got this deal thorough, missed our deadline and lost a prime minister over it - there needs to be some coming together.\"</p><p>Mr Javid claimed he can break the impasse by doing a deal with Ireland to put a time limit on the backstop, in return for paying hundreds of millions of pounds to cover Dublin's costs of a new hi-tech virtual border.</p><p>Matthew Fell, the CBI's UK policy director, said: \"Businesses want all politicians to have an honest conversation about immigration.

Now he's trying to pretend he's not, but he's the most liberal person in the U.S. Senate. She's done terrible things (...) and she's a great tax advocate, like Joe (Biden),\" Trump said in a morning call to a Fox show, his favorite television network.<br/>Biden presented Harris as his running mate in the November 3 election in Delaware on Wednesday, and on the eve of next week's Democratic National Convention, where he will be confirmed as a presidential candidate.<br/>\"They want $4 trillion in taxes, it's going to be the biggest tax increase in history (...) and destroy the economy,\" predicted Trump, who added that with Biden and Harris \" we'll have a depression like never before. You'll have to go back to 1929.\"<br/>About Kamala Harris said she is \"some kind of crazy,\" and criticized her behavior during the controversial confirmation hearings of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual abuse by several women.<br/>\"I was so angry and had so much hatred with Judge Kavanaugh that I'd never seen a thing like it. She was the most angry in the group (...) They're all angry people on the radical left,\" he added.<br/>On the environment, one of Democrats' main concerns about the setback in the rules to combat global warming with the Trump administration, the ruler said Biden and Harris' agenda is \"absurd and crazy.\"<br/>\"They don't want fossil energy (...) and they want to rebuild the cities,\" said Trump, who said that with the Democrats' environmental plan it would bring down the Empire State Building.<br/>\"It's ridiculous (...) that you have to rebuild the cities because too much light comes through the windows, let's make the windows nice and small, tear down the Empire State Building and replace it without windows,\" he said.<br/>At another point in the interview, Trump also assured that Democrats \"don't want cows\" and that they intend to abolish all animals.<br/>In mid-July, Trump fired his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, because of the poor poll results, which gave Biden a two-digit lead, mainly due to the misunderstanding of the coronavirus crisis by the representative.<br/>Trump is behind Biden in polls for the November 3 election, which would now yield 49.4 percent of the vote to the Democratic contender, compared to 42.4 percent of the Republican ruler, according to the average polls drawn by the Real Clear Politics website.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

But the independent Vermont senator begins the long race with considerable strengths.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As well as a massive email list of supporters, Sanders has an impressive track record of local-level fundraising and a volunteer network that three years ago helped secure eye-catching primary successes in states such as New Hampshire.</p><p>Sanders is often dismissed as a joke. President Trump responded last week by welcoming \"crazy Bernie\" back into the political fray.</p><p>Sanders responded with interest. \"What's crazy,\" he tweeted back, \"is that we have a president who is racist, sexist, a xenophobe and a fraud\". With 20 months to go until America votes, the exchanges will get a lot more caustic yet.</p><p>Sanders' team announced $5.9m (\u00a34.5m) of donations in the first 24\u00a0hours following his declaration - far more than he raised at the outset of his 2016 campaign. Most contributions came from small donors, rather than the corporate cash relied upon by other candidates.</p><p>Last time, Sanders won 12 million primary votes and raised over $230m - and in 2020, this energetic septuagenarian could do even better.</p><p>For Sanders has never really stopped \"running\". He's ever-present on cable television, other Democrat candidates seek his approval and the Washington press pack hangs on his every word.</p><p>And with good reason. For, beyond his Corbynesque \"magic grandpa\" appeal, Sanders has seriously influenced the US policy debate. Many of his flagship policy prescriptions - free college tuition, free government healthcare, a marginal tax rate above 70pc - were once dismissed as extreme by mainstream Democrats. Now, within the party at least, they're very much up for discussion.</p><p>Sanders has long campaigned for a major uplift to the US minimum wage - frozen by federal law at $7.25 an hour since 2009. But five states and some of America's leading cities have recently invoked local regulations to raise this paltry minimum to the $15 Sanders has backed for years. \"It's not a 'radical' idea anymore,\" he says. \"Together, we are going to fight for workers in all 50\u00a0states and raise the minimum wage to $15 at the federal level\".</p><p>At a time when financial insecurity is spreading from US blue collar workers to the middle class, Sanders is tapping into the growing outrage felt towards the \"1 per cent\" ultra-rich.</p><p>\"We should not have grotesque levels of wealth inequality in which three billionaires own more wealth than the bottom half of the country,\" he declares.</p><p>Ten years after a financial crisis that destroyed thousands of US business and millions of jobs, anger at Wall Street, remains palpable. Sanders places himself firmly in the corner of ordinary people.</p><p>\"If somebody wants to call me a radical, OK,\" he says. \"I believe people\u00a0are inherently entitled to healthcare, entitled to get the best education they can, I believe people are entitled to live in a clean environment\".</p><p>Appealing to female Democrats, Sanders courts the \"pro-choice\" lobby, at a time when some fear a reversal in the rights of women to seek legal abortion. \"I'm running for president because we must defend a woman's right to control her own body against massive political attacks taking place at the local, state and federal level\".</p><p>It is clear that Sanders' rhetoric is now heavily influencing other politicians. His thunderous opposition to tax avoidance strategies pursued by the tech giants paved the way for 29-year-old congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to attack Amazon's plans to build a huge new facility in her home city of New York.</p><p>Sanders has long attacked Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos, tabling anti-low-wage legislation dubbed the \"Bezos Act\". Ocasio-Cortez just followed suit, launching a broadside so fierce, shared repeatedly over social media, that Amazon announced a stunning reversal of its plans for a New York headquarters.</p><p>Yet this Amazon episode illustrates why Sanders, and those who mimic him, have no chance of winning. Ocasio-Cortez's outbursts gleaned wall-to-wall media coverage and acres of \"celebrity endorsement\". But the bottom line is she chased away up to 40,000 well-paid jobs from Long Island City, Queens - a part of New York ripe for development.</p><p>Ordinary voters want the tech giants to behave, yes, but polls show more than 70pc of New Yorkers wanted Amazon's HQ to be built.</p><p>One reason Sanders won't win the Democrat nomination, let alone the presidency, is that he has a problem with African-American voters. In 2016, he suffered a crushing loss in South Carolina's Democratic primary - taking just 14pc of the African-American vote, compared to 86pc for Hillary Clinton.</p><p>He has since made an effort, going on multiple trips below the Mason-Dixon Line and last month spending Martin Luther King's birthday in South Carolina, where he met with black leaders, elected officials and students. But in today's America, when Democrat voters want more racial and gender diversity, Sanders has no chance.</p><p>The only straight, white man who could gain the Democrat nomination is Barak Obama's vice-president Joe Biden - because he'd receive a warm Obama endorsement and, as a respected statesman, he has a chance of beating Trump.</p><p>In general, the US economy is doing quite well. Growth in 2018 outpaced the year before, bucking the global trend. GDP expanded by 3.4pc in the third quarter, with official figures for the final three months of the year due out on Thursday. Wall Street is now trimming those fourth-quarter forecasts, with JP Morgan expecting a significant slowdown to 1.4pc. That's another reason Sanders' presidential bid will fade - because, as the economy turns down, Americans are less likely to take chances with wild card candidates.</p><p>Polls show that while support for \"socialism\" in America is rising, only around 25pc of voters are comfortable with the term, whereas over 60pc still have a \"positive view\" of capitalism. Sanders has influence and has moved the policy dial. But he has no chance of becoming president.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-52014531</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VGT-MK41-F021-61MY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1030\"/><timeReceived>8:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 23, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Solano agrees with the government's strategy of opening tourism in stages, so that cases do not skyrocket and foreign tourists feel safe.She states that the current opinion of by the zones inhabitants with regards to the return of tourists to the area is divided into two large groups: one that wants the beaches to be opened immediately and another more cautious, which supports the government's strict measures.'Most of us want responsible tourism, thinking in the long term. After all, what foreign visitors are going to look for are safe places to vacation. It is something with which we can better market ourselves ; it is much better to have fewer cases when re-starting to market abroad', Solano declared.</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>AH1N1 vaccinations start next week</p></bodyText></listItem></list>She adds, 'I agree with the Government's strategy of reopening gradually, we must not go crazy. But it is also true that reactivation is urgent and needed: a single large hotel that opens, restores employment for 300 or 500 people '.'The key to the revival of the province is money to be circulating on the streets, that people spend, in order to have economic reactivation. With regards to this, it will be vital to have low prices, considering that we will have to bet , initially, strongly on national tourism. Also as a province we must promote creative tourism, appealing to the folklore and Guanacaste roots.

             President Trump on Sunday touted his record with African Americans, saying he has done far more for blacks than 'any other president' and that 'Crazy Bernie (Sanders) and the Democrats' should take note.</p><p>The president on Sunday subtweeted a video posted to Twitter by the two pro-Trump social media vloggers Diamond (Lynnette Hardaway) and Silk (Rochelle Richardson).</p><p>'Crazy Bernie and the Democrats should see this,' the president wrote in the caption.</p><p>'I have done far more for the African American community than any President.</p><p>'Secured funding for HBCUs, Criminal Justice Reform, Opportunity Zones, School Choice, Record Low Unemployment, and so much more.</p><p>'THE BEST IS YET TO COME!'</p><p>HBCU is the acronym which stands for historically black

selling crack cocaine to ask a judge to reduce their prison sentences.</p><p>It's a belated recognition, supporters say, that tough-on-crime policies that required lengthy prison terms for crack dealers were too punitive and fell most heavily on African Americans.</p><p>Sanders, the senator from Vermont, is riding high after his victory in the Nevada Caucuses on

And to mark the occasion, he got quite the birthday present from his supporters. Embattled[1] Trump 2020 chief Brad Parscale claimed, Monday morning, that the campaign took in a record one-day online haul Sunday. 'Quite a birthday gift for @realDonaldTrump yesterday!' Parscale tweeted. 'Biggest single-day ONLINE fundraising total ever - $14 million.'Quite a birthday gift for @realDonaldTrump[2] yesterday! Biggest single-day ONLINE fundraising total ever - $14 million. That's grassroots support that Sleepy @JoeBiden[3] can only dream of. The enthusiasm gap is real and it is wide!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain[4]!</p><p> /WRhOrNzOmD[5] \u2014 Brad Parscale (@parscale) June 15, 2020[6]Fox News reports[7] that the $14 million figure represents the combined donations to the Republican National Committee, Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., and the Trump Make America Great Again Committee. Overall, the president boasts of a war chest in excess of $250 million, compared with approximately $100 million in the campaign coffers of former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden had to navigate through a crowded Democratic primary, but as the party coalesced around him, donors have followed. May fundraising totals are not yet out, but the campaign set records in March and April \u2014 topping $40 million[8] and $60 million[9] respectively in those months. Trump previously took in nearly $25 million[10] in a single day last June \u2014 when he officially launched his bid for reelection. But that figure included all donations \u2014 not just those made online. The $14 million haul offered a rare bit of good news Parscale has been able to bring to his boss in recent days. Trump is reportedly growing frustrated[11] with his campaign manager amid lagging[12] poll numbers[13]. Have a tip we should know?

This caused the CNN host to raise the question 'should we in the press even spend time on those quotes from the president and the VP if they're misinformed?'  'Yes,' Stelter answered for himself, 'because the public needs to evaluate the distance between their words and reality.' After panning the president for railing against his political enemies on Twitter while Americans continue to die from Covid-19, Stelter said 'even though it's insane, we have to fact check what he's doingbecause poll after poll shows most Americans don't trust what President Trump says, but some people do.' 'It's not about whether to cover what the White House is saying, it's about how to do it,' Stelter said. Pointing to Trump's dismissal of the coronavirus months ago, Stelter continued with his argument that 'we need to make sure people remember what happened then and what may happen next.'  'The president's statements matter even though many of you say we shouldn't air the briefings, the briefings shouldn't be seen. The present's statements matter because they show his wellness, his competence or his lack thereof. When a grandparent is not well, the entire family feels it. The entire family shares the pain. Thousands of families know what that's like right now. The American family is experiencing it too. When someone is not well, when a leader is not well, we all feel it.' Watch above, via CNN.

Their 40th anniversary year features their annual Choral Pilgrimage, now in its 19th year, which began earlier this month and resumes in June. In the intervening months, Christophers and his musicians will prepare a staging of Handel's Belshazzar at the Grange Festival, Hampshire. And in August he will conduct the world premiere of James MacMillan's choral symphony Le Grand Inconnu at the Edinburgh International Festival.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, MacMillan has been fairly central to the Sixteen's recent repertoire, and the Pilgrimage's Voices of Angels programme includes his setting of O virgo prudentissima, commissioned by John Studzinski, of the Genesis Foundation, who also stumped up the money for the new symphony.</p><p>\"For our 40th anniversary, I'm going back to grass roots,\" Christophers says, \"so I've included one of the first pieces we performed, Robert Fayrfax's Aeternae laudis lilium, an extended motet commissioned by Elizabeth of York [Henry VII's queen]. It's very elaborate, very long. The first letters of the first 21 lines spell out her name and title in Latin: Elisabeth Regina Angli\u00e6. We also return to The Eton Choirbook and Robert Wylkynson with a nine-part antiphon to the Virgin Mary.\"</p><p>As is their custom, the programme has already been released on the Sixteen's label, Coro, under the title An Enduring Voice, and includes pieces by their \"signature\" composer, John Sheppard - who restored the musical glory of the Roman Catholic liturgy in Mary Tudor's reign. The Tudor polyphony is interspersed with pieces by Eric Whitacre, MacMillan and the late John Tavener, all of whom one might call neomedievalist modernists.</p><p>\"It's a challenging mix, but I think it will work,\" Christophers says. \"We're still very much a group grounded in the Renaissance, so I suggested this text to James, which he based on a fragment of Wylkynson's setting of this beautiful Italian poem.\"</p><p>Christophers has been steeped in church choral music since his time as a child chorister at Canterbury Cathedral and later as a lay clerk (or adult chorister) at Westminster Abbey.</p><p>\"The choir started in fledgling form after Oxford, around 1977, but two years later we decided we needed a name for our first London concerts. Our longest-serving member, Sally Dunkley, officially retired from the main group 18 months ago, but she still 'deps' for us.\"</p><p>The Pilgrimage comprises concerts in towns and cities across the land, from Truro to Edinburgh. It opened at the Kings Place concert hall, in London, but most of the venues are churches, college chapels and cathedrals where the Sixteen have built up a following for their annual visits.</p><p>\"It's humbling,\" Christophers says, \"because the reaction we get is, 'Thank you so much for coming.'\" Indeed, their visits have become sellout dates for the churches' communities. During their recent tour of Monteverdi's Vespers, local singers reinforced the professional forces. Education through participation - it's one of the Sixteen's most powerful contributions to the national music scene.</p><p>Christophers has a thriving career as a non-specialist conductor. He is music director of Boston's Handel and Haydn Society until 2021. \"I'm closing my term with a performance of Haydn's Creation, which the society first performed less than 20 years after the premiere.\" And much of this summer will be spent preparing and performing Handel's oratorio Belshazzar.</p><p>\"It's the most perfect baroque 'opera', with terrific choral music, but it's new to me. I did Saul, Jephtha and Semele at Buxton, but I've never done Belshazzar. It's the oratorio I think most cries out for stage production, with its dramatically conflicting choruses of Persians, Babylonians and Hebrews.\"</p><p>Handel is good box office in the UK, but Christophers says they struggle to sell any of the oratorios other than Messiah in Boston. \"It's difficult. I've done all of the ones I've recorded, but audiences still don't come.\"</p><p>Christophers was one of the pioneers of in-house recordings. After his label, Collins Classics, folded in 1998, he created Coro, cannily buying most of his Collins recordings and reissuing them under the Sixteen's imprint.</p><p>His Wigmore Hall event this week, with Michael Pennington reading from Pepys's diary, focuses on music by Purcell's older contemporaries: John Blow, Pelham Humfrey and Captain Cooke. It is almost a breather before a hectic summer schedule. \"It's jam-packed, and I have to have a life!\"</p><p>The new MacMillan symphony will be heard, after Edinburgh, at the Barbican in October. Christophers describes it as his most formidable challenge to date. \"It's a big symphony, immense, a huge score with masses of percussion, piano and harps. John Studzinski said to me, 'I need an oratorio about the Holy Spirit, but there's nothing.' I've done a lot of MacMillan, but mostly either a cappella or with a small string orchestra. This is something else.\"</p><p>                   The Choral Pilgrimage resumes at the Old Royal Naval College, London SE10, June 5; Belshazzar, Grange Festival, June 20-July 6; James MacMillan's Le Grand Inconnu, Usher Hall, Edinburgh, August 17. An Enduring Voice is out now on Coro (COR16170)                   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-52875046</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWC-2X41-JCJY-G2P2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"892\"/><timeReceived>11:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 13, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000093</classCode><className>ANNIVERSARIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000707</classCode><className>FESTIVALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N711130MM</classCode><className>MUSIC GROUPS &amp; ARTISTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DL5A</classCode><className>RELIGIOUS FACILITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CNRX</classCode><className>RELIGIOUS PILGRIMAGES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009XG5</classCode><className>BRITISH MONARCHS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000A0RH</classCode><className>CATHOLICS &amp; CATHOLICISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009VG1</classCode><className>MUSIC COMPOSITION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000707</classCode><className>FESTIVALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N711130MM</classCode><className>MUSIC GROUPS &amp; ARTISTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009XG5</classCode><className>BRITISH MONARCHS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008X5L</classCode><className>PERFORMING ARTS CENTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GX106</classCode><className>LONDON, ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DH8Z</classCode><className>WESTMINSTER, ENGLAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>\r\n","Citation":""
